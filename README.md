# CSS Style sheets, latex templates, etc. for making documents look better

## The preferred way to make a document is to write in markdown (in vim) and to use pandoc to create a PDF or HTML page. Relevant commands are as follows:

* pandoc -s -c style/style.css -o html5 outputdocument.pdf inputdocument.text

* pandoc -o outputdocument.pdf inputdocument.text

## redirect.css

This style sheet is for squid's redirect pages (whenever I get squid working).

## syllabus-style.css

Is obviously a style sheet for syllabi.
